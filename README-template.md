## 🧩 Overview

### About the challenge

The challenge was to build out a **QR code component** and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.  
Users should be able to:

- View the component centered in the page.
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements (if any).
- View the layout optimally on all screen sizes.

This was a great beginner project to practice **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, and **component alignment** techniques.

### What I learned

This project helped me practice layout techniques and understand the importance of spacing, alignment, and simple responsive design.

Here’s a snippet I’m proud of:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--clr-slate-300);
}
```
